# concept: todo

an idea, not a plan. nothing here is built yet.

tasks for one person, offline, fast to add and fast to tick. no accounts, the
data lives on the device, sync comes through what zugriff already has.

## the task

```js
{
  id, title,
  notes    : '',          // markdown
  done     : null,        // when it was ticked, null while open
  list     : 'inbox',     // one list (a project)
  tags     : [],
  priority : 0,           // 0 none, 1 low, 2 medium, 3 high
  due      : null,        // a date, or a date and time
  remind   : null,        // when to tell, may differ from due
  repeat   : null,        // see below
  parent   : null,        // a subtask points to its task
  order    : 0,           // the place in its list
  created, changed,
}
```

repeat stays small: `{ every: 2, unit: 'day' | 'week' | 'month' | 'year', on: [1, 3] }`
(weekdays or days of the month), and whether the next one counts from the due
date or from the day it was done. ticking a repeating task makes the next one.

## adding

one field, a line of text, read as it is typed:

```
call anna tomorrow 9:00 #family !2 every week
```

becomes the title `call anna`, due tomorrow at 9, the tag `family`, priority 2,
weekly. the words for days and times come from the language of the page
(`Intl` for the names of weekdays and months, a small table for "tomorrow",
"next week"). what was read shows as chips under the field, a chip can be
removed before saving.

## views

- **today**: due today and overdue, then what is starred
- **upcoming**: by day, the next weeks
- **lists**: one per list, sortable by hand
- **tags**, **done** (the history), **search**
- **someday**: no date, not in a list

## working with it

- swipe right ticks, left schedules or deletes (`dismissable` of
  `@aufbau/gestures`), a long press lifts a row to sort it (`sortable`)
- the keyboard: `n` new, `x` tick, `e` edit, `t` today, `/` search
  (`.shared/js/modules/hotkeys.js`)
- edit in the `context` area: `input-date`, `input-time`, `input-chips` for
  tags, `write-md` for notes, subtasks as a list below
- undo for the last tick and delete (a `pop-toast` with an undo button)

## reminders

- browser: the notifications api through the service worker, shown when the
  app is open or the worker wakes. without a push server that is unreliable,
  so a reminder is also shown at the next start
- capacitor: the local notifications plugin, reliable, scheduled when a task
  is saved

## storage and sync

`@bunker/db`, a table `tasks`, one `lists`. `onChange` keeps two open tabs in
step. sync, in this order:

1. **export / import**: json, and plain text in the todo.txt format
   (`x 2026-10-07 (A) call anna +family due:2026-10-08`), which other apps read
2. **a file in a granted folder or on webdav**: the json written there after a
   change, read at start, merged by `changed` per task (the newer one wins, a
   deleted task leaves a tombstone)
3. maybe **markdown**: a list as a `.md` file with `- [ ]` lines, so `apps/notes`
   shows the same tasks. nice, but a second format to keep in step

## open questions

- todo.txt as the file format right away, or own json first?
- the markdown bridge to notes: worth it?
- one list per task, or several (like tags)?
- calendar: a `widget-calendar` for picking and an upcoming month view, now or later?
