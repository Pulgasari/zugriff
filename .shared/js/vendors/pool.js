// them at once, queueing the rest — so a burst of work (a page of thumbnails,
// a folder of books to parse) overlaps without opening an unbounded flood of
// promises at the same time. no workers, no i/o of its own: it only decides
// *how many* of your promises are allowed to be in flight.
//
//   import { createPool } from './pool.js';
//   const gate = createPool(3);
//   const cover = await gate(() => extract(file));   // waits for a free slot
//   await gate.all(files, f => extract(f));            // whole batch, 3 at a time
//
// modelled on the inline limiter lib/thumbs.js grew — pulled out so every app
// (and brigade.js, for its submission side) shares one implementation.
