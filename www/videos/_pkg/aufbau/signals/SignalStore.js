// @aufbau/signals/SignalStore.js
// a store of named, typed leaves.

/*
const ui = signalStore({
  view : { type: 'enum', values: ['grid', 'list'], value: 'grid' },
  dark : { type: Boolean, value: false },
}, { key: 'app:ui:', storage: 'local' });

ui.view              // the EnumSignal itself
ui.view.value        // 'grid'
ui.view.cycle()      // its own methods, where the type has them
ui.$view             // 'grid'   — the value, no .value
ui.$view = 'list'    // and writes it

ui.get('view')                        // 'grid'
ui.set('view', 'list')                // one leaf
ui.set({ view: 'list', dark: true })  // several
ui.toggle('dark')                     // the leaf's own toggle
ui.reset('view')                      // back to the declared value, ui.reset() for all

a store grows after the fact, either by schema or by handing it a signal:

ui.$extend({ busy: { type: String, value: '' } });
ui.busy = StringSignal('');

every leaf declares its type. that is the whole point of the mandatory `type`:
the old factory read a plain object as config, so `signal({ x: 0, y: 0 })` quietly
produced an empty scalar instead of the record it looks like. here the shape of a
leaf is stated, not guessed.

// :::::: PERSISTENCE
// one entry per leaf under `key + leafName`, never one blob: a write rewrites only
// the leaf that moved, and a leaf missing from storage keeps its declared default,
// so a later change to that default still wins.
//
// the schema a store is built with persists as a whole (`persist` optionally
// allow-lists it). a leaf added later does NOT, unless it says `persist: true` —
// most of what an app hangs on a store afterwards is working state that has no
// business in storage.
